## Questions:
a.	Would it be okay if the bulk of writing is the introduction and methods? At this point, I am in the process of replicating Germani et al. (2025) and running their scrips (and trying to debug), so I’m not sure if the current plan is too ambitious. 
b.	For the discussion, is it okay to include more subjective reflections on the process of learning? Or should it be solely technical (4.a)
